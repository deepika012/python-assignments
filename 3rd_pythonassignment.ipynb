    "#1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a piece of code which we can use multiple time in a program just by calling their name.If we write a piece of code inside a function we don't have to write it again and again whole code in the program.therefore they are very useful.some of the advantage of fuctions are:\n",
    "1- Function reduces the complexity of program making it more readable.\n",
    "2- Funtions reduces the repetitiveness of the same code.\n",
    "3- It becomes easier to find the error in the program after using the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?\n",
    "\n",
    "code in the function runs when it is being \"called\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "statement which consists of a function name , parameters enclosed inside brackets , consist of a keyword called 'def' , and the expression which needs to be executed inside a funtion creates a function.\n",
    "we can even use 'pass' keyword if do not want to write expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g- function to print \"hello world\"\n",
    " \n",
    " def my_fun():\n",
    "   print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "#4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "  function : function is a statement which is created to define the work of a particular function. Here we are just defining the name of the function, what parameteres will it take, what expression it will perform, not executing anything.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  function call: function call refers to calling the function in the middle of the program whenever we need it.\n",
    "                 when we call the function, execution of the code written inside the function starts and return the desired output.\n",

    "#5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be only one global scope in pyhton as one module has one gloabal scope and the the variable will get forgotten when program will get terminates.\n",
    "As when a variables are declared at the top of the all the other function and is accessible to all other blocks of code is considered as global scope of a python.\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas number of local scopes depends upon the number of functions we have inside our module.\n",
    "As local scope of a variable is valid inside the function only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "when the function call returns, the variable present inside the local scope destroyed as now they are of no use if program gets terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    return statement is basically used to invoke the function so that the statements passed can be executed. It also refers to the end of the function definition.Anything written \n",
    "    after the return statement inside the function will not get executed. Return refers to the end of the function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    yes it is possible to have a return value in an expression.like we can say \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"return a+b\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a function does not have a return statement in a function, the values written inside print() statemnet will get executed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we want that our variable inside the function refer to the global variable just add the \"global\" keyword before that variable name.\n",

    "    \n",
    "#10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     None keyword is used to define a variable as null value. Null doesnot indicates that the value is 0 or empty.\n",
    "     for e.g if we want to print the numbers in the ascending order from the list. There needs to be one number which should less than that first particular number inside the list.so there we use none.We can't use other number from there bcoz we don't know what numbers are there inside that list.\n",

    "#13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "     \n",
    "     If we want to prevent our program from crashing, we can use Try/except block while writting the code.\n",
    "     we will write code to be executed inside the try block, and will add a message inside the except block which will flash up \n",
    "     if code in the try block has a error.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     In this way our program will not crash down, instead it will return the warning message.\n",

    "\n",
    "     Try and except are use to prevent our code from crashing down.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     under the try block:\n",
    "     we will write the piece of code which we want to execute.\n",
